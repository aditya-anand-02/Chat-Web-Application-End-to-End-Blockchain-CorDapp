# Chat-Web-Application-End-to-End-Blockchain-CorDapp

This Chat Application uses concepts of Blockchain, Rest APIs, WebServices, Corda Blockchain API and is programmed in Java Language. It is an end to end Chatting Web application that provides an interface to the user for end to end secure text messaging.
The project executes the following principles:

Network Setup: Set up a Corda network with multiple nodes representing different participants in the chat application. Each node can represent a user or an entity involved in the chat system.

Message State: Define a Corda state to represent chat messages. The state can include attributes such as the sender, recipient, timestamp, and message content. Use Corda's Contract DSL to define the rules for message creation and validation.

Chat Flow: Develop Corda flows to handle message exchanges. Flows can facilitate the sending and receiving of messages between participants. Corda's flow framework allows for secure and reliable communication between nodes.

Message Storage and Retrieval: Design a mechanism to store and retrieve chat messages on the Corda ledger. You can leverage Corda's Vault service to store and query message states securely.

Integration with Front-end Interfaces: Build front-end interfaces (e.g., web or mobile applications) for users to interact with the chat application. These interfaces can communicate with the Corda network using Corda's APIs to send and receive messages.

Privacy and Encryption: Implement privacy and encryption measures to protect the confidentiality of chat messages. Corda's privacy features, such as point-to-point messaging and transaction-level visibility control, can help ensure the privacy of sensitive communications
